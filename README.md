This script was created for the purpose of exploring scripting techniques in a development setting.
Its primary use is for educational purposes within a safe, private environment.
It is intended for learners, scripters, and curious developers who want to deepen their technical knowledge.
The script is meant to demonstrate how automated targeting systems work from a programming standpoint.
One core concept demonstrated is raycasting, which helps determine the direction and collision points in 3D space.
The script also introduces object detection logic, allowing the code to find and focus on nearby targets.
Vector math is a fundamental part of this script, teaching users how angles, positions, and rotations are calculated.
It also walks users through targeting logic, giving insights into how systems prioritize movement and selection.
This script should inspire users to study and learn, not to exploit or dominate others unfairly.
It is not a gameplay enhancement tool and should never be treated as one.
Use of the script should remain in private sessions and not be shared in multiplayer environments.
Testing and development should occur only in offline or isolated Roblox environments.
The script was not made for use on public game servers or in any live, competitive matches.
Game communities deserve respect, and this script is not intended to disrupt their experiences.
Ethical responsibility is a key part of programming and development.
Scripts like this can ruin games if used irresponsibly, which goes against the learning purpose.
We want to clearly state that we do not support the use of this script in the game Da Hood.
Da Hood has a history of being targeted by exploiters and aimbot users
This script was not made with Da Hood in mind and should not be used there in any form.

üö® Disclaimer on Use and Platform Risk
This script was developed and provided solely for educational and offline learning purposes. It was never intended to be executed, injected, or uploaded into live Roblox servers or public game sessions. Its purpose is to teach developers about targeting systems in a private, isolated environment that does not interfere with the actual Roblox player experience.
Attempting to use this script outside of an educational or development context‚Äîespecially within online multiplayer games‚Äîposes a significant risk to your Roblox account. Roblox has strong detection systems in place designed to identify automated behaviors and scripts that interact with gameplay in unintended or unauthorized ways.
Uploading, injecting, or running this script in any public experience connected to the Roblox network may result in disciplinary action. This can include, but is not limited to, temporary suspensions, permanent bans, or restrictions from features such as game creation, group management, trading, messaging, or even account login access.
These actions are typically irreversible and are carried out automatically or by Roblox moderation staff without prior warning. Once a violation is flagged, your ability to appeal or reverse the decision may be extremely limited, especially in cases involving exploitative scripts, automated targeting, or other unfair advantage mechanisms.
It is important to understand that even experimenting with this script on a live game‚Äîregardless of your intent‚Äîcan result in unintended consequences. Simply joining a game with unauthorized scripting tools running in the background may trigger moderation systems or raise suspicion on your account.
By choosing to interact with this script, you accept full responsibility for ensuring it remains in private, safe, and ethical use cases. You should not attempt to bypass, circumvent, or interfere with Roblox‚Äôs platform protections, detection algorithms, or terms of community safety. This includes avoiding use in any popular games such as Da Hood or similar combat-based experiences.
In summary, using this script on Roblox network services may be considered bannable behavior. If you are serious about learning, respect the platform, the developers who contribute to it, and the players who enjoy it. Always use educational tools like this one responsibly, privately, and with a commitment to fair play and ethical development

üéØ Disclaimer on Impact to Other Players
Although this script was developed for educational purposes, it is important to understand the real consequences of using a targeting or aimbot system in public or multiplayer Roblox games. Scripts like this can severely disrupt the experience for others and create an unfair, toxic, and frustrating environment.
When an automated system is used to aim or target players with unnatural precision, it removes the skill-based balance that many games are built around. This gives one player an artificial advantage that others cannot reasonably compete with, leading to discouragement and anger among legitimate players.
In combat-focused games such as Da Hood, the presence of aimbots can make gameplay feel rigged or pointless for others. Players may feel cheated, targeted, or driven out of the game, even if they are trying to enjoy it fairly. This can reduce player retention, damage community morale, and unfairly punish those who follow the rules.
Exploit scripts like this also create reputational harm for games themselves. Developers spend time and effort building fair, competitive, and rewarding gameplay systems. When aimbots are introduced, it reflects poorly on the game and its community, regardless of whether the developers are at fault.
Unethical script use can lead to increased moderation, harsher restrictions, or even the shutdown of community features by developers who are forced to react to misuse. This affects everyone‚Äînot just the individual running the script. Your actions have ripple effects across the entire user base of a game.
Players may also report the presence of exploiters or aimbot users, triggering unnecessary reviews or moderation by platform staff. In some cases, innocent users can be caught in the crossfire of someone else's abuse of automation tools, creating a harmful atmosphere of distrust and conflict.
The enjoyment and progress of real players are negatively affected when they are repeatedly targeted by users running unauthorized scripts. They may lose matches unfairly, be kicked from games, or stop playing entirely. This kind of disruption discourages honest participation and can severely shrink active communities.
Even when used in a ‚Äútesting‚Äù capacity during live gameplay, scripts like this send the message that cheating is acceptable if the user has technical knowledge. That undermines the values of fair play, effort, and creativity that Roblox promotes. Educational scripts should inspire learning, not manipulation or superiority.
In conclusion, using this script in online or public environments is not just a risk to your account‚Äîit is harmful to the player experience as a whole. If you value the Roblox community, other players, and ethical game development, do not use this tool outside of a safe and private learning space.
